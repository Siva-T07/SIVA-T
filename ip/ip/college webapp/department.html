    The Computer Science and Engineering department started in the
year of April 2013 with a vision to become a Centre of Excellence by
making the students to compete and adapt to the changing pace of the
industries.

The Department strives with an outlined vision in producing socially
responsible and employable engineers. It has a team of well qualified
and highly experienced faculty members and technical staff who deliver
their skills to the students through 360 teaching-learning environment
which includes deployment of Moodle, Video Tutorials from NPTEL,
Spoken Tutorial which are all streamlined with NMEICT. Some of the
bright students are pursuing MITx courses for enhanced learning. The
faculty members impart knowledge through curriculum based formal
education and industry focused informal education which enhances the
aptitude and reasoning skills of the students to make them readily
employable.

The Department has modern, well equipped and updated infrastructure
facilities to achieve the target of making students readily
employable. The Computer Centers provide Central Computing facility
across 950+ nodes which are backboned by IBM 8 Blade Servers and
Juniper Networks. Nodes have communication outlet with a speed of 245
Mbps dedicated leased line facility which can be accessed in both
wired and Wi-Fi environment. The department procured all latest
software including Oracle 11g, Rational Rose, Microsoft Open Value
Subscription through Microsoft Campus agreement to enable the students
to develop their practical skills.
