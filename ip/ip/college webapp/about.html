<h2>Ramco Group</h2>
<br>
<div>It was 1938 when reverberations of the Industrial Revolution had
not yet reached the interiors of South India. Despite scarce capital
and resources, Shri P.A.C. Ramaswamy Raja had setup the first Spinning
Mill at Rajapalayam, which later became the focal point of the Ramco
Group. His sharp focus on technology and quality has inspired a
generation of entrepreneurs and formed the basis for the collective
vision of the Group

Under the stewardship of our Founder Chairman Shri P.R.
Ramasubrahmaneya Rajha, son of Shri P.A.C. Ramaswamy Raja, the Ramco
Group has expanded into a USD 1 Billion industrial conglomerate with
interests spanning cotton and synthetic yarn, cement, building
products, software solutions, wind-energy, education and more. It
continues to grow under the visionary leadership of our present
Chairman Shri. P.R. Venketrama Raja. The Group has become one of the
most reputed business houses in India and has achieved international
recognition for its quality products and services.

Ramco Institute of Technology, (RIT) is fully supported by the Ramco
group to create quality Engineers for future needs.
